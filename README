# Public Health Pipeline

Lightweight ETL pipeline that ingests CDC Socrata data, stages it in PostgreSQL, performs cleaning/validation, and optionally loads validated data to BigQuery. Includes a small Validation API and simple alerting.

## Repo layout
- orchestrator.py — pipeline orchestration and run logging
- pipeline.py — ingestion, staging, cleaning, BigQuery load
- validation_api.py — FastAPI service that runs data-quality checks
- alerts.py — logging/sendgrid alert helper
- run_pipeline.sh — helper runner (start API, wait, run orchestrator)
- docker-compose.yml — Postgres service for local development
- tests/ — unit/integration tests
- .env — environment template (not committed with secrets)
- logs/ — runtime logs and validation output

## Prerequisites
- macOS with Python 3.10+
- Docker + docker-compose (for local Postgres)
- Google Cloud SDK or service account JSON if using BigQuery
- Install Python deps:
```sh
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
